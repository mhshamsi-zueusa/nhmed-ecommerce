<p><strong>E</strong>ach year, thousands of unsuspecting seniors sustain deadly slip and fall incidents. Today, falls are the second leading cause of injury-related deaths for senior citizens from ages 65 to 84. Although the risks associated with falling are grave, there are steps that seniors and their caregivers can take to prevent injuries before they occur.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Common Injuries</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Height of impact</li>
<li>Speed of fall</li>
<li>Landing area</li>
<li>Previous injuries</li>
<li><em>And more</em></li>
</ul>



<p>As a result, there are countless bodily risks associated with falls. Some of the most common include <strong>broken bones or fractures, brain injuries, spinal cord injuries</strong>, hip fractures, and more.</p>



<p>Hip fractures are especially immobilizing, as half of all seniors 65 and older with a hip injury are never able to return home from hospital care. Likewise, 87% of bone fractures for individuals 65 years or older are caused by falls.</p>



<h3><strong>Psychological Implications</strong></h3>



<p>Although slips and falls are an important consideration throughout the elderly community, seniors should not need to change their lifestyle due to fear of falling. Unfortunately, this is the case for as much as 25% of individuals aged 75 and older. Thatâ€™s why at New Hampshire Medical Supply, our goal is to provide life-changing products that improve quality of life, peace of mind, and confidence for elderly citizens and their caregivers.</p>



<h3><strong>Bathroom Safety Equipment</strong></h3>



<p>With modern advancements in medical supplies, elderly citizens can reduce their chances of harmful falls and increase their overall health and life fulfillment. Each of the following products is offered by our trusted team at New Hampshire Medical Supply.</p>



<h3><strong>Raised Toilet Seats with Rails</strong></h3>



<p>Oftentimes, medications and certain medical conditions may require seniors to use the bathroom more frequently. When positioning themselves to use the toilet, individuals with mobility issues may put themselves at risk while squatting or standing up. Raised toilet seats alleviate this risk by offering easy access with less required range of motion. Likewise, rails provide greater stability by providing multiple points-of-contact during movement.</p>



<h3><strong>Bedside Commode</strong></h3>



<p>While transiting to the bathroom, seniors are at a higher likelihood of falling, especially during nighttime movements. By utilizing a bedside commode, individuals can relieve themselves without walking to the bathroom. As an added benefit, seniors can reduce the number of bathroom-related accidents and enjoy greater peace of mind at home.</p>



<h3><strong>Grab Bars, Bath Chairs, and Transfer Benches</strong></h3>



<p>Due to wet and slippery conditions, falls are especially common in showers. By implementing grab bars, seniors can easily step in and out of their shower or bathtub with greater stability. Likewise, a bath chair offers additional comfort and support, reducing the amount of time spent standing while showering. For individuals who have a difficult time getting into the shower, a transfer bench enables them to sit on the outside of the bathtub and slide to the inside without having to step over a tall barrier.</p>



<h3><strong>Closing Remarks</strong></h3>



<p>By incorporating the proper stabilizing equipment, seniors are in a better position to prevent dangerous slips and falls before they occur. Whether you are seeking quality medical equipment for yourself, a loved one, or someone you look after, our compassionate team at New Hampshire Medical Supply is here to help. We invite you to browse our medical equipment and supplies, and we are always available for any questions or concerns that you may have.</p>



<p>Thank you for your consideration, and we look forward to hearing from you!</p>
